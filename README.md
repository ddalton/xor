0. Parallel dispatcher implementation
   a) use aliases to create a wide fan-out aggregatetree
   b) use inheritance to create a wide fan-out aggregate tree
1. Explore replacing IN (<subquery>) with EXISTS (<correlated_subquery>)
   also remove any unnecessary tables from the join in the subquery,
   unless it participates in the critical path or has a predicate clause
2. Duplicate child entries - new test
3. Doubly nested child query tet
4. TO_ONE child query test
5. root object downcast
6. Subtype querying and json/state enhancement
7. Paging test - tokens and parallel collections
8. Collection of embedded objects

Benchmarks
==========
Run OO7 BENCHMARK against XOR
http://oo7j.sourceforge.net
~/Downloads/oo7

poleposition - A bit simpler than OO7, but should be easier to add XOR.

Fix narrow call by replacing it with the ability to resolve the object based on the subtypes and join condition
- see JSON representation


1. Refactor to use JSONObject to represent view and not list of properties.
   Allows for rich expression of the query.
   StateGraph construction should be based off JSON.
   Filters should be added to StateGraph so the queries can reflect them and not get them from the settings object

2. Test subquery
   Add limit and next token functionality to the QueryTree
   How do splits and query filters interact. Need to ensure the stitching filters out the object correctly.

3. Multi-column foreign key test
4. Entity filter test. Also need to test it in split scenario. See #2.
7. Test same entity type but on different anchors and ensure it brings different shapes

0. Type narrowing of a property - see JSON representation
   NarrowHandler(options)
   options include
   - SUBCLASS NONE (no sub classes included)
   - SUBCLASS ANY (default behavior)
   - SUBCLASS a
   - SUBCLASS (a, b)
   - SUBCLASS NOT b 
   - SUBCLASS NOT (a, b)
  
1. Process ALIAS and NARROW functions - See JSON representation
  How is an alias field processed? Add a property to an open type
  StateTree#extend
    a) Alias test of an existing property e.g., 
       taskDetails t1
       taskDetails t2
    b) Alias test of a non-existing property e.g., root

2. SP multi query ordering

3. include/skip functionality
