This is where you can find documentation about XOR, including code snippets,
best practices etc.

## Helpful Hints

On the right side is the index to the documentation. You can either
browse the documentation using the navigation buttons at the bottom of each page or directly go to
the page you are interested in.

If you come across anything along the way that we haven’t covered, or if you
know of a tip you think others would find handy, please [file an
issue]({{ site.repository }}/issues/new) and we’ll see about
including it in this guide.
