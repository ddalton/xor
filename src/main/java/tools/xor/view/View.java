/*
 * If no view/qualifier is specified then we return all the properties and children of the aggregate
 * 
 * We are not dealing with an XML document, so there is no inherent context to work with, i.e, one cannot navigate to a parent from the root etc..
 * Also XML document is a tree and not a graph and we have to deal with references, so we need additional constructs to represent that.
 * 
 * The view also allows qualifiers with special meaning.:
 *   <path><empty>    - If the path represents an entity, then include only initialized properties
 *   <path>.<path>*   - recursive path
 *   <path>.(<path>)* - recursive path with multiple elements in a recursive chain
 *   
 *   List the structure and copy the desired subset into the view.
 *   
 *   
 *   
 *   DEPRECATED below
 *   <path>//         - All descendants
 *   <path1>//<path2> - Any property anchored with <path1> that ends with <path2>
 *   !<path>          - Exclude the particular path pattern from the view. The negative rules have greater precedence.
 *   <path>.âˆž         - All the properties including descendant objects of the aggregate and other associations
 *                      This can potentially load the complete DB!
 *                
 * Precedence rules:
 * 1. ! - Highest precedence
 * 2. <path> 
 * 3. <path>//<path>
 * 4. //<path><qualifier>
 *                 
 * Examples: 
 *   <path>//      - All descendants of the aggregate anchored at <path>
